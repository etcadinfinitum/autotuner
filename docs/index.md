# Autotuning Signals in Matlab

A project by [Lizzy Presland](https://linkedin.com/in/etcadinfinitum), [Bo Simmons](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowman-simmons/), and Jayden Fullerton.

# Summary
A brief description of what the project does/is about, suitable for someone unfamiliar with the application area.

# Background
An introduction to the application area, including how your project fits into the existing state of the art. You should have done a literature search and read some real (i.e., non-web) reference material.

# Techniques
Course concepts and algorithms covered by the project. This section is the core justification that this project should result in a good grade for you.

# Design
A complete design description. It should be extensive enough for someone else to continue development of the project.

# User Guide
How does your software work (from the user’s point of view)? Should include things like screen shots. Illustrate the sytem in operation with real execution examples. A screencast video would be appropriate here (but is not required). If you want to do this, please contact me ahead of time to deliver the video separately, since I assume that it will be too big to submit via Canvas.

# Alternative Approaches
Discusses other possible ways to implement this.

# Limitations
What your project doesn’t do, that it might have, given time and motivation.

# Problems
Problems encountered and solutions applied (or, if not solved, possible avenues for solution).

# Future Work
Suggested extensions to your program.

# References
Cutting across these topics, your report should make it clear what you learned, relating to both the course material and any unexpected problems or issues that gave you new insight.
