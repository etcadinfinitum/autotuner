# Autotuners in Matlab

Final project for Signal Processing (CSS 457) at UWB.

## Report

See [the project website](https://lizzy.wiki/autotuner/) for a detailed 
writeup about our work on this project.

Sound clips and images were an essential part of conveying our work and 
results for this project, so we leveraged a website in favor of a standard 
PDF report.

## Building the site

We used [this GitHub Action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) 
to build the site to be served via GitHub pages. Custom build steps 
were required in order to utilize [a packaged Ruby gem for Jekyll-native 
custom tables and MathJax](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship).
