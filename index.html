<p>A project by <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/etcadinfinitum">Lizzy Presland</a>, 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bowman-simmons/">Bo Simmons</a>, and 
Jayden Fullerton.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this project, we work to create a utility which processes an audio 
file (for example, human speech or synthesized musical notes) and 
and produces an audio which has its pitch corrected to a desired 
frequency in the Western chromatic scale. We achieve this through the implementation 
of a basic, peak-based, pitch-shifting phase vocoder. Tuning is achieve by using a 
Short-Time Fourier-Transform to allow us to isolate fundamental frequencies, calculate and 
perform shift, then use an Inverse Short-Time Fourier-Transform to reassemble 
the now tuned signal. Results including spectograms and audio files for two such 
attempted implementations are included, and future work and areas for improvement are outlined.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In the music industry, the process of pitch correction, informally known 
as autotuning, is a common practice. Its musical merits are <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/music-and-theater-arts/21m-380-music-and-technology-contemporary-history-and-aesthetics-fall-2009/projects/MIT21M_380F09_proj_mtech_3.pdf">in constant 
dispute</a> 
in the music industry, but its prevalence and popularity in many 
genres of popular music has secured the technique’s importance in music 
production and in digital signal processing (DSP).</p>

<p>Traditionally, in music, artists will have to continually take attempts of a song
until they get a satisfactory attempt where the notes the artist produces/sings line up
with the intended notes from the song composition. However, artists producing vocals
that are up to standard is very difficult, and autotuning allows less talented artists
to produce songs that appear to be from a very talented artist. There is controversy over this,
as some thinks it takes away from the talent of being an artist, as less
talented artists can sound better than they actually are. Others argue in favor of autotune,
saying it allows artists to put more emotion into their songs than they could otherwise because
they need less attempts.</p>

<p>The implementation of an autotuner is closely related to the more general 
DSP technique known as a <em>phase vocoder</em>. A phase vocoder is a common technique
that is used to process audio signals. This is done using a Short-Term Fourier
Transform, which will be discussed in more detail later. This technique (or variations
of it) are used in a lot of autotuning software.</p>

<h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>

<p>To analyze the frequency content of the audio signal, we utilized 
short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs) of the input signal. This technique 
decomposes the audio signal into a series of Fourier transforms, which 
allows the time domain signal to be represented as a series of 
frequency domain spectra. With this technique, we can analyze the 
frequency components of a signal to determine which frequency or frequencies 
are represented in a small time window of the signal, and work to make changes 
to that frequency spectrum to achieve our desired results.</p>

<p>This approach, described by Laroche and Dolson (1999), can be outlined as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a Short-Time Fourier-Transform for the input signal.</li>
  <li>Detect peaks within the STFT.</li>
  <li>Calculate frequency shift for each peak.</li>
  <li>Shift the frequency of each peak.</li>
  <li>Inverse the STFT in order to produce a tuned signal.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps will be elaborated on further through the remainder of this section.</p>

<p>Our group made two attempts at implementing this approach. The first worked at 
effectively tuning individual pitches, but was particularly choppy and at times 
failed to identify the correct frequency shift. For this reason, we took a second 
approach. The results section contains data from both, but the remainder of the techniques 
section focuses on the second of our attempts at implementation.</p>

<h3 id="1-short-time-fourier-transform">1. Short-Time Fourier-Transform</h3>

<p>A short-time Fourier-transform breaks a signal into windows of a known time duration, and 
applies an FFT individually for each window.</p>

<p>This is critical because it doesn’t just tell us which frequencies are present in the 
signal as a whole, but during which manageably sized tme durations those frequencies 
are present. This is what enables us to tune different points in the signal to different 
pitches, and also to reconstruct the signal later after shifting pitches.</p>

<p>Our final approach fits Laroche and Dolson’s description of a basic, peak-based, pitch-shifting phase covoder. 
Like our solution, their basic approach utilizes a fixed, uniform window size (the segments on which the ffts are made) 
and allows a fixed 50% overlap. This is a more simplistic and naive approach, but has half the computational complexity 
of using 75% overlap (Laroche &amp; Dolson, 1999).</p>

<h3 id="2-peak-detection">2. Peak Detection</h3>

<p>When implementing pitch correction, our first approach was simplistic. 
We elected to locate the frequency with the largest magnitude in each 
column of the STFT, which we assume is the fundamental frequency for that 
transform. This was true for both approaches.</p>

<h3 id="3-and-4-calculating-and-implementing-frequency-shift-for-each-window">3 and 4. Calculating and Implementing Frequency Shift for each Window</h3>

<p>Once a fundamental frequency had been identified, we then performed a raw offset of the column 
containing that transform so that the fundamental frequency of each STFT column resided in the 
frequency-domain bin which was closest to the target frequency.</p>

<p>One of the critical differences between our first and second implementations was that our second 
was able to use multiple target frequencies. The method responsible (detailed below) accepted a vector 
of target frequencies as a parameter and matched each window’s fundamental frequency to its closest match 
allowing us to tune to an input scale, or other set of frequencies, rather than a single pitch.</p>

<h3 id="5-inverse-short-time-fourier-transform">5. Inverse Short-Time Fourier-Transform</h3>

<p>After performing modifications to the signal’s STFT, it is necessary to 
convert the frequency domain representation of the modified signal to the 
time domain. To accomplish this, we take the inverse of the STFT, which 
inverts the process used to produce the STFT. First, the inverse FFT of 
each frequency domain window is calculated, and then the time domain 
signal values are rescaled using the inverse of the same mapping used to 
scale the input signal’s window. If a Hamming window is used, the reciprocal 
of the scale value for each element is used to rescale each element in 
the inverted FFT. Lastly, if the overlap parameter is non-zero, the resulting 
reconverted signal is cumulatively at the offset specified by the overlap 
parameter.</p>

<p>Our second and final approach to autotuning utilizes an overlap-add approach to 
istft which utilized the Overlap-add method (pictured in Figure 1). This involves essentially 
aligning the overlapping portions and adding them together, as described by Radiner (1975). The 
ISTFT implementation we used was one we found online (<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/e4810/matlab/s24/istft.m">here</a> ).</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>To isolate the processing and transformation of a signal, and the parameters 
required to perform these tasks, we created a class <code class="highlighter-rouge">AutoTuner</code> to provide 
object members and functions which perform the steps necessary to perform 
pitch correction. Such a structure allows for multiple pitch correction 
approaches to be written and documented. We explicitly decided that the 
client utilizing the class would be responsible for calling the class 
functions which perform pitch correction and convert the frequency domain 
STFT back into a time domain signal. Separating each of these steps gives 
the user greater control over inspecting and graphing the signal at various 
steps in the process.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we also decided that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AutoTuner</code> class would not have 
any graphing utilities embedded into the</p>

<p>Our final design relied primarily on the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>tuneSampled()</strong> to perform the stft using Matlab’s spectrogram function, pass the output to correctPitchSpectrum(), then perform an istft on the result.</li>
  <li>
<strong>correctPitchSpectrum()</strong> to iteratively perform peak detection and pitch correction for each window of the stft.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="approach-2-mult-pitch-target-autotuning-peak-based-phase-vocoder">Approach 2: Mult-Pitch Target Autotuning, Peak-Based, Phase-Vocoder</h3>

<p>These are the results for the second approach, using 50% window overlap, fixed 
window length, and a non-object-oriented approach. We were able to improve our 
turning, as well as choppiness and overall fidelity to the original audio’s sound 
characteristics.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this approach, Matlab’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">spectrogram</code> function was used rather than the stft function, partially for the purpose of consolidating code where spectrogram’s needed to be produced anyways. The bulk of the process was performed by a single method, <code class="highlighter-rouge">correctPitchSpectrum</code>. That’s method’s function definition is shown below in Code Block 1.</p>

<p>Our first step was validating this second approach. To this end, we generated an audio file with constantly increasing frequency (available below), and attempted to tune it to the C-Major scale. This proved effective, and the tuning shows in the spectrogram as horizontal steps for each change in pitch.</p>

<p>Next, and as a point of comparison between the two approaches, consider the C-Major scale .wav file used for testing purposes above. The output was choppy, an not entirely on pitch. Note that our expectation is no significant pitch change, with a secondary goal of maintaining sound characteristics.</p>

<p>Note that while the displayed results were achieved by first adding the two channels of audio sampled from the original .wav file, the same result was achieved by separately tuning each channel and recombining at the end. This is to be expected for a scale.</p>

<p>There are two key observations to make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, the tones are smoother and appear to be the correct pitch.</li>
  <li>Second, the duration of the output audio is slightly shorter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first observation is reflective of the fact that this second approach works extremely well for single tone audio, while the second is reflective of the fact that, during the peak identification process, the beginning and end were ever so slightly truncated.</p>

<p>While the C-Major scale provides an example of the advantages of this second approach over our first, now consider the Vajrayana chant.</p>

<h3 id="approach-1-single-tone">Approach 1: Single Tone</h3>

<p>Following these steps will allow anyone to run the software and 
reproduce our results or experiment with user-supplied sound samples.</p>

<p>The relevant structure of our project is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── matlab/
│   ├── AutoTuner.m
│   ├── driver.m
│   ├── pitchTable.m
│   ├── spectrogramPlot.m
│   ├── test_audio/
│   ├── test_images/
│   └── utils
│       └── AnalogSignal.m
└── sounds/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each of the Matlab files listed here performs specific functionality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">AutoTuner.m</code>: A class which rovides the core implementation of our pitch 
correction approaches and necessary utilities.
It contains an object constructor which stores the input arguments and other 
necessary parameters for creating the STFT and its inverse. There are 
other important methods in this file which perform pitch correction and 
create the STFT and its inverse.</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">driver.m</code>: the driver for the end-to-end processing of an audio file. 
It contains a utility method called <code class="highlighter-rouge">performSinglePitchAutoTune</code>, which 
allows the user to decrease the repetitiveness of the various steps 
needed to produce STFT modifications, spectrograms, and audio files for 
the resulting pitch correction.
This file also contains calls to produce pitch correction results for 
different inputs.</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pitchTable.m</code>: Contains a matrix of the frequencies of the Western 
chromatic scale from octave 0 through octave 8.</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">spectrogramPlot.m</code>: Creates plots of the STFT and the modified STFT 
to show the original and pitch-corrected value of the signal in the 
frequency domain.</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">utils/AnalogSignal.m</code>: we wished to produce an example of the target 
frequency so that the target frequency and processed input can be 
compared with each other by the listener. To do this, we utilize the 
AnalogSignal class provided by Prof. Stiber.</li>
</ul>

<p>To provide new sound samples, add audio files to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sounds/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Then, navigate to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">matlab/</code> directory and open up the <code class="highlighter-rouge">driver.m</code> file.</p>

<p>Around line 7, there are a series of calls to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">performSinglePitchAutoTune</code> 
method. You may add, remove, or reorder these calls as you see fit, and 
you may add a call to process a sound file you have provided.</p>

<p>If, for example, you wanted to process an audio file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">example.wav</code>, 
you would move it to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sounds/</code> directory, and in <code class="highlighter-rouge">driver.m</code>, add a 
single call:</p>

<div class="language-matlab highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">performSinglePitchAutoTune</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'example'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'wav'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pitches</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="s1">'test_images/example'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, from the Matlab IDE or from the CLI application, you can invoke 
the pitch correction process by simply typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">driver</code> to run the script file.</p>

<p>The software produces spectrogram plots of the original signal’s STFT 
and the modified STFT after pitch correction has been applied. The software 
also produces the following audio files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A copy of the target frequency tone, saved as <code class="highlighter-rouge">test_audio/tone_&lt;desiredPitch&gt;hz.wav</code>
</li>
  <li>A copy of the pitch correction result of the original signal, saved as <code class="highlighter-rouge">test_audio/&lt;audioFilename&gt;_tuned_&lt;desiredPitch&gt;.wav</code>
</li>
  <li>A concatenated version of the input, desired tone, and resulting signal after pitch correction, with half a second of silence between each signal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="approach-2-multi-pitch-targeting">Approach 2: Multi-Pitch Targeting</h3>

<p>Following these steps will allow anyone to run the approach 2 component of our software in order to tune audio input to any specified set of target frequencies. Calling driver2.m specifically will allow users to reproduce our results or experiment with user-supplied sound samples.</p>

<p>The relevant structure of our project is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── matlab/
│   ├── driver2.m                             (will run tests whose results appear in report)
│   ├── tuneSampled.m                         (first part of core logic)
│   ├── correctPitchSpectrum.m                (second part of core logic)
│   ├── tuneSampledTwoChannelsSeparately.m    (unnecessary, add channels and use tuneSampled)
│   ├── pitchTable.m                          (Contains half-step chromatic scale to target)
│   ├── cmajorPitchTable.m                    (Contains C-Major scale to target)
│   ├── test_audio/                           (Destination of output audio files)
│   ├── test_images/                          (Destination of output spectrograms)
│   └── utils
│       └── depricatedistft.m                 (Not ours, essential to produce audio output)
└── sounds/
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Each of the Matlab files listed here performs specific functionality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>driver2.m: The driver with code sections for running each of the tests with shown results. Instructions for adding custom audio can be found below.</li>
  <li>tuneSampled.m: Responsible for executing both the initial Short-Term Fourier-Transform before passing the spectrum to pitch correction, and also for executing the Inverse Fast-Time Fourier-Transform on the result from pitch correction. This corresponds to steps 1 and 5 from the process outlined in the ‘Techniques’ section. Additionally, tuneSampled will play tune audio when it finishes, save a copy of the tuned audio, and save pre and post-tuning spectrograms.</li>
  <li>correctPitchSpectrum.m: This contains the rest of the core logic, corresponding to steps 2, 3, and 4 of the process outlined in ‘Techniques.’</li>
  <li>pitchTable.m: Contains a matrix of the frequencies of the Western chromatic scale from octave 0 through octave 8. This is passed as the set of target frequencies in many of our test cases.</li>
  <li>cmajorPitchTable.m: Analagous to pitchTable.m, but containing only the pitches found in the C-Major scale.</li>
  <li>depricatedistft.m: This was, as stated above in the ‘Techniques’ section, downloaded and not our own code. It uses the Overlap-Add algorithm to inverse the STFT and produce the tuned digital signal, which in turn can be turned into the audio output.</li>
</ul>

<p>The addition of audio files is the same as for the previous single tone tuning approach.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous approach, you will need to navigate to, and edit, driver2.m.</p>

<p>Insert, at line 14, one of the following two options (replacing anything in and including angle braces with the appropriate values you want as specified):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
<p>Case A: Single Channel Audio File</p>
</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>[ogSignal, Fso] = audioread(audiofilename);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>[ts Fs] = tuneSampled(ogSignal, Fso, windowsize, nfft, wavename, targetPitchesVector);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
<p>Case B: Two Channel Audio File</p>
</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>[ogSignal, Fso] = audioread(audiofilename);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>ogSignal = ogSignal(:,1) + ogSignal(:,2);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>[ts Fs] = tuneSampled(ogSignal, Fso, windowsize, nfft, wavename, targetPitchesVector);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, if you’re looking to prove to yourself that tuning Two Channel audio separately doesn’t make a difference, you could consider option C:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
<p>Case C: Two Channel Audio File, Tuning Channels Separately</p>
</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>[ogSignal, Fso] = audioread(audiofilename);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
<p>tuneSampledTwoChannelsSeparately(ogSignal, Fso, windowsize, nfft, wavename, targetPitchesVector);</p>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The inputs should be assigned values as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">audiofilename</code> - A string which is the name, including file extension, of the audio file you wish to tune.</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">windowsize</code> - An integer representing the intended window size for the Short-Time Fourier-Transform. (Recommendation: 1000).</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">nfft</code> - An integer denoting the nfft sampling points for calculating the discrete fourier transforms. (Recommendation: 1024).</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">wavename</code> - A string meant to uniquely identify this wave and its output. Must conform to your systems file name character requirements.</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">targetPitchVector</code> - A vector of frequencies which represents the set of pitches which you hope to tune your audio to. (Recomendation: Start with the pitch table).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once those additions have been made for each file you wish to test, save driver2.m.</p>

<p>Once that’s complete, you can run driver2.m by typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">driver2</code> in the Matlab IDE or using the CLI.</p>

<p>Each of those cases above will produce the following outputs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Spectrogram of the Original Signal - This can be found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">autotuner/matlab/test_images/</code>.</li>
  <li>A Spectrogram of the Tuned Signal - This can be found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">autotuner/matlab/test_images/</code>.</li>
  <li>A .wav Audio File of the Tuned Result - This will play audibly, and also be saved to <code class="highlighter-rouge">autotuner/matlab/test_audio/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>How does your software work (from the user’s point of view)? Should include things like screen shots. Illustrate the sytem in operation with real execution examples. A screencast video would be appropriate here (but is not required). If you want to do this, please contact me ahead of time to deliver the video separately, since I assume that it will be too big to submit via Canvas.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-approaches">Alternative Approaches</h2>

<p>There are several types of “alternative approaches” which, essentially, fall into the category of being more sophisticated 
versions of the same approach we’ve taken. For this reason, those alternatives can be found in the “Future Work” section below. 
This section enumerates completely separate approaches to auto-tuning.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Another approach is the Phase-Vocoder Pitch-Shiting technique, which is not peak-based, described by Laroche and Dolson.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some ways a completely different direction, we could have attempted to build our auto-tuner around a real-time pitch detection algorithm.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An approach we could have taken that was rather similar could have been using the Pitch-Synchronous Overlap-Add tool instead of pitch vocoding. The
main advantage to using PSOLA over pitch vocoding is PSOLA is designed to modify the pitch of the signal without modifying the other characteristics of
the signal. This is closely related to the STFT that is used in pitch vocoding. A main advantage of PSOLA is effeciency, as pitch vocoding is relatively ineffecient.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>While we managed to overcome our project’s initial limitation of only being able to tune to a single target pitch, we are still using an approach which is 
optimized for audio that plays a single tone at a time. Harmonizing is completely lost with our approach at this time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our approach does not work well with speech, or any sounds with nuanced characteristics, as it is not only vulnerable to noise, but produces a “choppy” output 
due to the smaller overlap we used to avoid ballooning computational complexity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are only capable of auto-tuning recorded audio, and only if the user already has the audio file on-hand to place into the appropriate directory. We can neither 
handle the recording of new audio, nor the tuning of real-time audio. Both are significant to most actual auto-tuning applications.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<h3 id="language--and-domain-specific-issues">Language- and Domain-Specific Issues</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For this project, we chose Matlab to implement our pitch correction tools. 
There are significant benefits to this: easy manipulation of multidimensional 
arrays, straightforward handling of complex values, and convenient 
built-in methods for Fourier transform operations, to name a few.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we experienced inconveniences with Matlab in this project; 
the wall-clock computation time for producing pitch corrections varied 
between dozens of seconds and whole minutes, depending on the length of 
the input audio file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also difficult to prototype specific functionality, because the 
process of loading an audio file, calculating its STFT, performing 
pitch correction, and calculating the inverse STFT is a very linear 
process. The methods we wrote were complex enough, with many required 
parameters, that trying to call them from the Matlab CLI could be 
confusing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These problems may have been easily mitigated if we had begun development 
of the pitch correction implementation with a clearer design for the 
application in mind, and decoupled some of the steps from each other 
in more intelligent ways.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="implementation-issues">Implementation Issues</h3>

<p>Our approaches have numerous potential issues, the most significant of 
which we list here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>By taking the single largest magnitude in each frequency-domain bin, 
this implementation is susceptible to signal noise. If a noisy component 
of the signal, or a harmonic overtone, has a larger magnitude than the 
fundamental frequency of the speaker or sound source, then the pitch 
adjustment will be adjusted to pitch correct the incorrect signal 
component.</li>
  <li>In complex sound structures which have natural overtones, the overtones 
which have lower magnitudes in the frequency domain are not 
properly scaled when the fundamental frequency is shifted to the 
target frequency bin. This behavior corrupts the sound and introduces 
pitch beating and distortion to the pitch corrected version of the 
signal.</li>
  <li>It is quite possible that this implementation does not perform necessary 
pre- or post-processing of the frequency spectra after pitch correction is 
applied. After the frequency-domain STFT is shifted to attempt pitch 
correction, the inverse STFT operation produces a complex-valued signal, 
which is to be expected if the STFT doesn’t correspond to a real-valued 
input signal. However, a complex-valued signal which must be represented 
with real values will certainly lose fidelity, and it’s possible that 
an effective pitch correction process would minimize or eliminate 
any complex-valued inverse transforms.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As noted in the problems section above, there are many suboptimal strategies currently
being used in regards to the autotuning. Before attempting an expansion of the project,
many (if not all) of these issues will need to be resolved. The most important change out
of those listed in the problems section would be choosing frequency-domain bins that better
reflect the part of the signal that needs to be modified (i.e. analyzing the bin rather than
picking the maximum from the bin).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could computer the Harmonic Product Spectrum in order to highlight peaks for fundamenta 
frequencies. This would not work in every case however, and we’d want it to be an optional approach 
with some sort of flag governing that logic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To address the problem of noise susceptibility, a better approach would 
perform cluster analysis of high-valued magnitudes in a single transform 
bin in the STFT; such an analysis would be more likely to find patterns 
of significance in the distribution of frequencies to locate the average 
fundamental frequency with greater accuracy. It would also be advisable to 
examine the most significant frequencies over a range of individual 
transforms in the STFT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a sound contains harmonics or other frequency components, they should 
almost certainly be scaled so that a pitch correction for a located 
fundamental frequency has its overtones and other frequency components 
scaled to a frequency which allows the proportions of the pitch corrected 
frequency bins to maintain the same relative proportions as the unaltered 
spectra.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The software could be ported/implemented in another language such as Python.
This could allow potential integration with a user interface with a simple file
input/output using either compressed (mp3) or uncompressed (wav/aiff) audio files.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
